# DataAnalyticsProject
Final project for DA: Collect/Store/Retrieve Data 

Goal of the project was to utilize the processes of collecting, storing and retrieving data to solve any problem of one's chosing.

Project Proposal:
Collect FASTA formatted coding DNA sequence (CDS) files of various organisms from Ensembl's publically available FTP website. Read the data into the R enviroment to then parse the lines to isolate individual sequences for each organism. Store the data within a SQL database. Retrieve the data via SQL queries to find a evidence of codon frequency bias across organisms.

Feedback on submission:
"Could have included more visualizations of conclusions"
